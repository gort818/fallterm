A python log creator,viewer, and printer


A python curses program utilizing  bash scripts to allow users to create logs or data entries using vi,
to print said data entries, make new directories, etc.

Dependencies:

Python3,Python3 curses, and bash.

So far I have only tested the program with linux, it might work with OSX but I don't have a machine to test with,

Note: 
This is a work in progress and any help in refining the code would be greatly appreciated!
